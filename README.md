slides
======

Now that my [git-slides](https://github.com/gelisam/git-slides) repository has became popular, it no longer makes sense to use that repository to host my personal presentations. Thus, I will keep the main git-slides repository solely for the tool and its demonstration presentation, and I will host all my other presentations in branches of this second repository.

Of course, as with all git-slides presentations, be warned: the public history of those branches will be rewritten mercilessly.
