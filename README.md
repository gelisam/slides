A meta-presentation about the three presentations I enjoyed the most at the [Compose Conference](http://www.composeconference.org):

1. [Stephanie Weirich](https://github.com/sweirich)'s ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6klfKLBnz9k)),
1. [Anthony Cowley](https://github.com/acowley)'s ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-JFkv9-JOQ)), and
1. [Lindsey Kuper](https://github.com/lkuper)'s.

Of course, as with all git-slides presentations, be warned: the public history of those branches will be rewritten mercilessly.
