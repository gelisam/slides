Bonus: monadic composition

  * sequence two systems. that is:
     - run the first system until
       it produces a value.
     - if needed, use the value
       computed by the first
       system to determine what
       the second system should be.
     - run the second system.
     - the value produced by the
       combined system is the value
       produced by the second system.
