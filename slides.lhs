Binary codecs

> data Codec a { encode :: a -> ByteString
>              , decode :: ByteString -> Maybe a
>              }

Primitives:

> charCodec :: Codec Char


Combinators:

> listCodec :: Codec a -> Codec [a]

> pairCodec :: Codec a -> Codec b -> Codec (a, b)
















































































































                   Combinator libraries

          Benefits                      Costs

        * Shorter                     * Need some up-front design to find
          (work hidden in combinators)  the proper primitives and combinators
        * More self-documenting
          (intermediate names)
        * Fewer mistakes
          (each system is consistent)
