// Now, before I go too far with this idea, I want to contrast it with a similar practice
// called "defensive programming". I think defensive programming is a good idea, and I
// wouldn't want you to walk away from this talk thinking that you should never validate
// your inputs, on the contrary. No, the point of this talk is that you should defend
// against the outside world, but not against yourself. That's why I call it "auto-immune",
// like an auto-immune disease in which your body has defenses which are meant to be used
// against outside threats, but uses them to defend against your own cells.
