Git vs Svn

* Git is new and popular (among developers and among our clients)
* Git is distributed (but we don't care about that)
* Git is powerful (this slide system runs on git's history-rewriting magic)

example:


    void say_hello() {
      printf("hello");
    }
    
    int main() {
      for(int i=0; i<10; ++i) {
        say_hello();
      }
      return 0;
    }
