* Git is new and popular (among developers and among our clients)
* Git is distributed (but we don't care about that)
* Git is powerful (this slide system runs on git's history-rewriting magic)

but...

* Git is new (you will have to learn a new tool)
* Git is distributed (you will forget to push your changes)
* Git is powerful (and more complicated)
