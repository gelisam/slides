How to create a spaghetti history:

  git push
To ../example-remote
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to '../example-remote'
To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected
Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull') before pushing again.  See the
'Note about fast-forwards' section of 'git push --help' for details.
  
  git pull
Already up-to-date!
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
  
  git push
To ../example-remote
   cd11f27..acbdf11  master -> master


The result:

  git log --graph --oneline --all --decorate
*   acbdf11 (HEAD, origin/master, master) Merge branch 'master' of ../example-remote
|\  
| * cd11f27 colleague's commit #1
* | 3da1271 my commit #1
|/  
* 1ab7fbc add exclamation mark, fixes showstopper
* 1444ea5 simple hello world
